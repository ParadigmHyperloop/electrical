# Electrical System for the Paradigm Hyperloop Pod

## Quick Start

All boards are built using KiCad EDA (http://kicad-pcb.org/).  It is free and open source software!

1. Download and Install KiCAD
2. Clone this Repo
3. Checkout a new branch or your branch other than master
3. Open the project file (.pro) for the board you are interested in
4. Make any edits, create a branch, add and commit the changes to git, then push. 

## Organization

All files for the current revision should be kept in folders in the root directory.
All files for a completed revision should be kept in folders in the appropriate "RevX" sub-directory.
Still not sure how we will handle when some boards need to be revved but not others...
