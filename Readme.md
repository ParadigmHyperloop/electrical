# Electrical System for the Paradigm Hyperloop Pod

## Quick Start

All boards are built using KiCad EDA (http://kicad-pcb.org/).  It is free and open source software!

1. Download and Install KiCAD
2. Clone this Repo
3. Open the project file (.pro) for the board you are interested in
4. Make any edits, create a branch, add and commit the changes to git, then push. 

## Organization

All files for the current revision should be kept in folders in the root directory.
All files for a completed revision should be kept in folders in the appropriate "RevX" sub-directory.
Still not sure how we will handle when some boards need to be revved but not others...
